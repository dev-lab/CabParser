===========

Provides a means to parse and extract data from Microsoft CAB files, from Java.

Specifically, this project was created to extract files from within a .cab which are compressed via the LZX compression algorithm.

Microsoft CAB file format: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb417343.aspx

- This is for cross-platform use, specifically - linux 32/64, mac 32/64, and windows 32/64. Java 6+


<h4>We now release to maven!</h4> 

There is a hard dependency in the POM file for the utilities library, which is an extremely small subset of a much larger library; including only what is *necessary* for this particular project to function.

This project is **kept in sync** with the utilities library, so "jar hell" is not an issue. Please note that the util library (in it's entirety) is not added since there are **many** dependencies that are not *necessary* for this project. No reason to require a massive amount of dependencies for one or two classes/methods.  
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.dorkbox</groupId>
